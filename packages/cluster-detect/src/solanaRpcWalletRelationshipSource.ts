/**
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * HONESTY NOTE (same standard `HeliusFeedProvider` and
 * `solanaRpcTokenMetadataProvider.ts` set for their own unverified judgment
 * calls): this build cannot reach Helius at all - the sandbox it was
 * written in blocks outbound connections to it - so every behaviour here is
 * verified against injected `SolanaHistoryRpcLike` fakes only, never a live
 * response. The two JSON-RPC methods used (`getSignaturesForAddress`,
 * `getParsedTransaction`) are standard and well documented, but the risky
 * assumptions are about the *shape and content* of what comes back:
 *
 * 1. FEE PAYER = `accountKeys[0]`. Solana's message format defines index 0
 *    of the account keys as the fee payer and first required signer, and
 *    web3.js preserves that order in `transaction.message.accountKeys`. This
 *    is a protocol-level guarantee, not a Helius detail, but it has not been
 *    observed against a real response here. For a pump.fun mint the fee
 *    payer of the mint's earliest transaction is taken as the deployer; if
 *    a launchpad ever pays fees on a creator's behalf, that attribution
 *    becomes "the launchpad", not "the creator" - see
 *    `deployerFromTransaction`.
 * 2. FUNDER via LAMPORT DELTAS, not parsed instructions. The funder is read
 *    as the account with the largest lamport *decrease* in the wallet's
 *    earliest transaction, given the wallet's own balance increased. This
 *    deliberately avoids matching on `parsed.type === "transfer"` shapes
 *    (System vs. `transferWithSeed` vs. a CPI from a program, all of which
 *    look different in `jsonParsed` output and some of which do not appear
 *    as top-level instructions at all); `meta.preBalances`/`postBalances`
 *    are positional arrays over the same `accountKeys` and capture the net
 *    effect whatever produced it. The known wrinkle is that the fee payer
 *    also loses lamports to fees, so on an unusual first transaction the
 *    "largest decrease" could be a fee payer rather than a funder - hence
 *    `MIN_FUNDING_LAMPORTS`, which ignores decreases too small to be a real
 *    funding transfer.
 * 3. PAGINATION REACHES THE TRUE EARLIEST SIGNATURE only if the endpoint
 *    returns a full page whenever more history exists and honours `before`.
 *    That is the documented contract; a provider that silently truncates
 *    deep history would make an old wallet's "earliest" transaction wrong.
 *    `maxSignaturePages` bounds the cost either way and records the result
 *    as unknown rather than guessing - and unknown is safe by construction
 *    (see `relationshipDataKnown`).
 *
 * Nothing here throws into the hot path: every lookup runs in the
 * background, and a failure leaves no cache entry so reads keep answering
 * "unknown".

 *   signature history. Two wallets sharing one -> `common-funder` edge at
 *   weight 0.9.
 * - a mint's DEPLOYER, from the fee payer of the mint's earliest (creation)
 *   transaction. Wallets that are the deployer, or are funded by it, are
 *   creator-associated -> `shared-creator` edges at weight 1.0 and the
 *   `creatorAssociatedWallets` cluster flag.
 *
 * Creator-association reuses the same funder cache rather than a second
 * lookup path, so adding it costs no extra RPC calls.
 *
 * CACHED PERMANENTLY, WITH NO TTL - the one large efficiency win this has
 * over `CompositeTokenMetadataProvider`'s 20s TTL. A wallet's original
 * funder and a token's deployer are *immutable*: they are properties of a
 * transaction that already happened and can never be superseded. Holder
 * concentration and liquidity change minute to minute; "who first sent this
 * address SOL" does not. So one successful lookup per address is the whole
 * lifetime cost, and a re-lookup could only ever return the same answer.
 * Failed lookups are the only thing retried, governed by the shared
 * `RpcRefreshGovernor`'s per-key cooldown.
 *
 * Reads are synchronous and never block: they answer from cache and, on a
 * miss, schedule a throttled background lookup. Until that lands the answer
 * is "unknown", which means no edge (a cluster may be missed) and - via
 * `relationshipDataKnown` - a deferred rather than granted auto-promotion
 * in `WhaleDiscoveryEngine`.
