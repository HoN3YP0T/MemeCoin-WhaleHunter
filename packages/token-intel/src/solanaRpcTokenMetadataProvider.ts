 * HONESTY NOTE (matching the standard `HeliusFeedProvider` and

 * calls): the three JSON-RPC methods this provider calls
 * (`getParsedAccountInfo` against an SPL-Token mint, `getTokenLargestAccounts`,
 * `getTokenSupply`) are standard, well-documented Solana RPC, and the
 * parsed SPL-Token mint layout (`mintAuthority`/`freezeAuthority`, null when
 * revoked) is part of the node's own `jsonParsed` encoding rather than
 * something this repo guesses at. But this build has no reachable Helius
 * endpoint to test against - the sandbox it was written in blocks outbound
 * connections to Helius entirely - so every behaviour below is verified
 * only against injected fakes (`SolanaRpcLike`), never a live response. The
 * parts most worth re-checking with a real key: that `getParsedAccountInfo`
 * on a pump.fun mint really returns `parsed.info` in the shape
 * `ParsedMintAccountInfo` describes (it should - that is the node's parser,
 * not Helius's), and that Helius's free tier tolerates this provider's
 * request rate (see `RpcRefreshBudget` for the throttle and its reasoning).
 * Mapping is defensive throughout: a shape mismatch or an RPC failure
 * degrades to the same `conservativeUnknownSeed()` fallback the other
 * adapters use, and never throws into the hot trade path.

/**
 * The recommended real-data `ITokenMetadataProvider`: DexScreener for the

 *
 * Why composite rather than an RPC-only provider: Solana RPC has no concept
 * of pool pricing, so an RPC-only provider would report `liquidityUsd: 0`,
 * which maxes out `liquidityRiskComponent` *and* fails
 * `tokenThresholds.minLiquidityUsd` in `entryGate.ts` outright. DexScreener
 * alone has the mirror-image problem: it cannot supply holder concentration
 * or mint/freeze authority state, so `conservativeUnknownSeed()` pins
 * `concentrationRisk` and `authorityRisk` to their maxima and imposes a
 * ~35-point floor on every token's risk score - above which realistic
 * pump.fun tokens no longer fit under `maxTokenRiskScore`. Merging the two
 * sources field-by-field is the only combination that answers all six
 * fields, and it needs no paid API.
 *
 * Field ownership:
 * - `liquidityUsd`, `marketCapUsd` <- DexScreener
 * - `holderCount`, `top10HolderPct`, `mintAuthorityRevoked`,
 *   `freezeAuthorityRevoked` <- Solana RPC
 * - `creatorAddress`, `creatorTokenLaunchCount` <- left undefined. Standard
 *   RPC cannot cheaply answer either (deployer attribution needs a
 *   transaction-history scan back to the mint's first signature), and
 *   `creatorRiskComponent` treats undefined as neutral 0 by design, so
 *   omitting them costs nothing rather than fabricating risk.
 *
 * The two sources degrade strictly independently, because they are two
 * separate caches: DexScreener's own provider already serves last-known-good
 * or conservative liquidity on its own failures, and the RPC cache here does
 * the same for its four fields. An outage on one side never blanks the
 * other.
 *
 * Like the other real adapters, `get()` is synchronous and never blocks on
 * I/O: it returns cached-or-conservative immediately and kicks off a
 * throttled, de-duplicated background refresh (see `RpcRefreshBudget`).
